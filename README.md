## Linguistics_Kiksht 

Linguistics_Kiksht is a repository to house and process language data for linguistic analysis of the Kiksht language varieties. The linguistic data is primarily text-based, and currently the data is being digitized and organized. The goal for this project is to be able to analyze the linguistic data using corpus methods and also to preserve the data using digital archiving methods. These methods are relatively new in the field of linguistics and language revitalization. Most of the methods being used here so far are exploratory corpus analysis methods. Literature review is also being conducted to understand how a highly polysynthetic language with such a limited amount of linguistic data can be analyzed using some of these aforementioned methods.
